I am Robotics Engineer at Southwest Research Institute. 


Pre-November 2022

I am a second-year Robotics MS student at Oregon State University, graduating in the summer of 2022, advised by Dr. Cindy Grimm and Dr. Ravi Balasubramanian. My research is primarily focused on robot hand design, manipulation, and benchmarking. In addition to my primary research for the last two years, I have led a multi-disciplinary team to develop test equipment to automate the testing of research involving robot manipulators. During my time as a graduate student, I have worked on projects ranging from developing a calibration process for locating a robot manipulator to a test environment; to a mobile 3D printer that can print onto curved surfaces. Outside of graduate school, I volunteer as an engineer mentor for a local FIRST robotics team, Scalawags 1359. As an engineer mentor, I primarily focus on teaching designing with CAD tools and the engineering thought process for mechanical design.
