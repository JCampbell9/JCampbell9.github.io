**Abstract**

We propose a task break-down approach for
manipulation tasks that is object-centric and that utilizes es-
tablished manipulator and arm benchmarks for evaluating fea-
sibility. This is accomplished by specifying object-centric sub-
tasks, comprised of hand-object contact areas, environmental
constraints, interaction forces, and object pose change. These,
in turn, can be matched to arm and manipulator capabilities as
captured by benchmarks. We demonstrate that this approach is
effective using a lock-and-key task with four different manipula-
tor and arm types. By comparing optimal and sub-optimal sub-
task sequences for each arm/manipulator combination, we show
that the task-breakdown framework effectively encapsulates
both possible sub-task sequences and enables evaluation of
sub-task sequences given an arm/manipulator combination. In
the lock-and-key task, the optimal sequences generated using
the proposed framework across four different robot hands
produced a more reliable approach to completing the task
(0% failure for optimal versus 46.5% failure for sub-optimal).
Furthermore, the optimal sequence completed the task by
rotating the key the full 90 degrees and did not pull the key
out while rotating.
